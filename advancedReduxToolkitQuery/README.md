# Redux Toolkit Query (Advanced)

This project is a blog app that uses Redux Toolkit Query to fetch data and make asynchronous requests. It is based on Dave Gray's [Redux Advanced Tutorial - React, Redux Toolkit, RTK Query Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9P2IUx13MZI) tutorial.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the main repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:alpozaslan/next-redux-learning.git
cd advancedReduxToolkitQuery
yarn install
```

Then, start the json-server - a fake REST API server:

```bash
yarn start-json-server
```

Finally, start the app:

```bash
yarn start
```
