# Next.js and Redux Learning Repository

This repository contains small projects that are I created while learning Next.js and Redux.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered or statically exported React apps. It provides a simple way to get started with React and helps you build apps that are optimized for performance, automatic code splitting, and better developer experience.

## What is Redux?

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It is often used with React, but can be used with any view library. Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

## Prerequisites

To set up and run the projects in this repository, you will need the following:

- Node.js
- Yarn (optional, but recommended)

### Project 1: Redux Toolkit Query

This project is a simple app that uses Redux Toolkit Query to fetch data and make asynchronous requests. It is based on Dave Gray's [Redux Toolkit Query Tutorial and RTK Query CRUD Example App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyZzCHgG3AY) video.
